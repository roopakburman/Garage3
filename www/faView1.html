		<hr></hr>

			<p class="item item-text-wrap">Business objectives and organizational models are changing rapidly, and so is the portfolio of work that PMOs support. Our research shows that nearly three in four projects are moderately or highly complex, meaning they involve geographically dispersed project teams, high numbers of requirements and stakeholders, or highly interdependent elements. This complexity is coupled with a rise in unfamiliar projects — organizations have limited experience in approximately 66% of the projects that they undertake.<br><br>To cope with the uncertainty and complexity of the project portfolio, PMOs must take three steps to improve their portfolio management and resource allocation:
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Avoid Portfolio Decision Overload:</strong> Governance processes at most organizations require multiple approvals from senior stakeholders, resulting in decision overload. Organizations must simplify their governance approach to help senior executives focus only on the most important decisions. Organizations can achieve this by adopting a governance approach which has 3 components – a decision framework to ensure that the right person makes each decision, predetermined criteria to help project teams make delivery trade-off decisions, and a qualitative assessment to assess the ongoing effectiveness of the process.</li>
				<li><strong>Identify substitutes to avoid delays from resource bottlenecks: </strong> Assigning resources to projects on an as-needed basis can result in significant project delays either because of a lack of a specific resource or an inability to quickly identify the most suitable one. Progressive organizations cover critical, short-term resource constraints by identifying substitutes based on the competency profile required for the successful delivery of a project.</li>
				<li><strong>Revamp Portfolio Prioritization Techniques: </strong>Cost-benefit analyses are often inconsistently defined and used in organizations, which results in unreliable estimates of project returns. To manage competing priorities and project demands between different business units, organizations should create a standard template to compile project-related costs and benefits information. This helps ensure an apples-to-apples comparison of projects and helps organizations give top priority to projects that are aligned to business priorities.</li>
