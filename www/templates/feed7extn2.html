					Organizations want employees to collaborate more and complete work faster. However, only 22% of employees report their organization effectively supports both collaboration and execution. More time spent collaborating can reduce the quality and speed of execution due to groupthink, lack of a common vision, and too many participants.<br><br>Organizations try to accelerate collaboration by restructuring and de-layering departments or giving management tools such as RACI charts to define relationships and authority. Unfortunately, these top-down approaches are too disruptive and can make work more complex. About 50% of employees admit having to work around these structures, rules, and tools.<br><br>The most effective way to solve the collaboration paradox is to equip teams to govern their own interactions, which increases enterprise contribution up to 25%. Companies can achieve this by helping teams eliminate unnecessary processes and avoid escalating decisions.<br><br>Lenovo rolled out a group evaluation process called fu pan—a Chinese term that translates to "replaying the chess board"—to help its employees replay the collaboration process. Employees can use fu pan to stop and pull up at any point in a process to review what is working and quickly make course corrections when necessary. Yi Min, head of Global Learning, says of fu pan, "It allows our whole workforce to strike that balance between speed and agility—we go slow to go fast."<br><br>Fu pan works where other group evaluations fail because it assesses the work being done, not individuals' performance. This avoids the unproductive tendency to blame individuals for problems. In one instance, a team at Lenovo used fu pan to uncover why a new tablet product was selling well only in certain markets. They discovered the floor display was the issue and redesigned it, immediately increasing sales. Lenovo's experience also reveals financial rewards aren't necessary to unlock enterprise contribution—the heart of the next paradox.
