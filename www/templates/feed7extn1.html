					Complex work environments require employees to be more independent (81% of CHROs agree), but they still need direction. Seven in ten employees can't prioritize competing tasks based on organizational importance. As PK Medappa, Group Head of HR at Standard Chartered Bank, explains the challenge: "We give our employees the freedom and empowerment to go about completing their tasks, but we also want to ensure we provide the right framework around what we want them to accomplish."<br><br>Organizations are trying to be more transparent with employees to give autonomy and direction. Believing knowledge is power, organizations regularly share financial and operating data and tie personal and enterprise objectives together through goal cascades. However, too much information can decrease enterprise contribution up to 13%. Without understanding why the information is relevant to them, employees struggle to see the value of the information they receive and connect their work to strategic goals.<br><br>It turns out employees need as much context as they do transparency. For example, communications that explain how employees can use strategic objectives as a lens for making everyday decisions can boost enterprise contribution by as much as 22%.<br><br>Leaders in Milliken & Company's Performance Products Division knew employees needed context—without exception— for a successful business transformation. So the material company's leaders developed a new practice to increase employee engagement and revenue.<br><br>First, they prioritized three key business metrics to teach employees how to visualize success for the organization and themselves. Next, leaders enlisted HRBPs to equip teams to translate these three metrics into relevant strategies and tasks. Finally, leaders had managers customize their communication of the division's weekly progress dashboard to encourage employees' use of key data when prioritizing daily tasks.<br><br>By contextualizing information instead of giving orders, managers encourage employees to be more proactive and help them better assess when and how to collaborate with peers.
