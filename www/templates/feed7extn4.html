        <h1><p class="item item-text-wrap">The Competition Paradox</p></h1>
		


					<p class="item item-text-wrap">
					Organizations want performance systems that drive team outcomes while differentiating individual performance. Yet in most situations, achieving differentiation means asking employees to cooperate with peers they view as competitors for promotions, assignments, and resources. As one head of HR told us, "Leaders understand that through cooperation we get our best outcomes, but the more they are under pressure to perform, the more they are forced to act as individuals."<br><br>Collaboration objectives do not fix the problem either. Most employees have them but see no negative consequences to ignoring them. Even when employees focus on these objectives, few know how to spot the right opportunities to contribute. In complex environments, performance systems must show why and how enterprise contributors win.<br><br>To solve the competition paradox for its employees, global law firm Herbert Smith Freehills asks partners to evaluate how their peers affected their work. As part of annual reviews, each partner allocates 10 points among the peers who most contributed to their success. Employees' points are compared to highlight the importance of impact over time spent collaborating. Points inform the balanced scorecard used for each partner's remuneration.<br><br>The system was so successful when piloted among Australian partners that the global executive team has implemented it worldwide.

				<h1  class="item">What Should CHROs Be Doing Now?</h1>
				<p class="item item-text-wrap">
					Leading heads of HR are combining employee data with a critical examination of their current performance strategies to uncover and prioritize the paradoxes impeding workforce performance. They are halting investments that motivate enterprise contribution to make new investments that make it easier to be an enterprise contributor. CHROs are also uncovering these paradoxes impeding their own HR teams and even piloting solutions for the broader workforce.<br><br>Contact your account manager to build your own tailored plan and deploy your CEB Corporate Leadership Council resources to transform your organizational environment to support seemingly opposite characteristics. In the process, you can increase the number of enterprise contributors in your workforce by up to 30 percentage points.
