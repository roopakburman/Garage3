					Managers and heads of HR often turn to financial rewards to incentivize positive behaviors, including paying employees to be collaborative. But surprisingly, linking pay directly to network performance actually makes employees 25% less willing to help coworkers. Financial rewards crowd out existing intrinsic motivation to collaborate by:<br><br>Making it an obligation, Encouraging employees to do the minimum required, and Calling out that a trade-off exists.<br><br>To make contributing intrinsically rewarding and not just reward contributions, organizations must create an environment of reciprocity. Enterprise contribution improves 10%-34% when peers enjoy contributing and can rely on and provide high-quality contributions to each other. Reciprocity does not need to be quid pro quo, but rather a flow of contributions to and from the network that benefits employees' work.<br><br>DIRECTV realized that fostering an environment of reciprocity was critical to innovation and collaboration efforts across silos. Leaders at the satellite TV company also knew reciprocity must be fun to be sustainable. So they launched an online failure-sharing platform to shift mind-sets from "Who can I blame for this failure?" to "Who can I teach what I learned from this failure?" Three transferable components propelled the social media platform's success, which helped reduce IT production errors by 30%.
